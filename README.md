# ForkBox
<!--ForkBox is a fork of VirtualBox to add improvements, removing some features/bloat that are useless, changing/reverting the junk new UI. etc. Not everything new is good!-->
ForkBox is a fork of VirtualBox. Our goal is to refine the VirtualBox experience by focusing on stability, performance, and a clean, traditional user interface.
We aim to remove unnecessary bloat and revert changes that we feel detract from the core user experience. If you prefer a more classic, streamlined approach to virtualization, ForkBox is for you.

ForkBox is a powerful x86_64 (and ARM, via v7.1+) full-virtualization tool for desktop, server, and embedded use. It runs on Linux, Windows, macOS, and Solaris hosts.

Key features include a streamlined and user-friendly graphical interface (reverting some recent upstream UI changes), flexible networking, and high performance. It's designed for anyone from developers testing software to users needing to run multiple operating systems simultaneously. <i>Not everything new is good!</i>
<!--just a general-purpose full virtualization software for x86_64
hardware (with version 7.1 additionally for macOS/Arm), targeted at laptop,
desktop, server and embedded use. (bla bla bla)-->

It features a very user friendly graphical user interface and is available for
many popular operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS and Solaris). Flexible
networking setup and interactive performance are the strong points.

Anyone with the need to run multiple operating systems simultaneously with some
basic knowledge about PCs and operating system installation can use it to
reduce effort with a large number of tasks including software testing.

## Getting started

ForkBox is a complex product with multiple dependencies, some of them
specific to the operating system on which you want to run it.

The basics for building ForkBox are described on the [build
instructions](https://forkbox.ixchats.com/build_instructions.html) page.

## Documentation

The [ForkBox User Guide](https://forkbox.ixchats.com/guide.html)
contains all information relevant for users, including the product features and
their configuration.

For developers it is recommended to start with the [technical
documentation](https://forkbox.ixchats.com/technical_documentation.html) which
contains links to a broad collection of pages related to development, covering
many aspects of the project and its features.

## Examples
Since ForkBox is a fork of VirtualBox, VirtualBox is sorrrta similar to ForkBox.. sorta? I mean to say we're too lazy to make tutorials.. ahem... The official VirtualBox documentation and tutorials are a great resource for getting started with general concepts, such as creating and managing virtual machines.
